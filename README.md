Project contents:  

A jigsaw puzzle-game that has 3 puzzles. Once you put down one puzzle piece, a piece of music begins to play. Once the puzzle is complete, a short video plays while the song is still playing, as if the puzzle image itself is “alive”. You can repeat the video if you wish. Both the music and the videos are from 1930’s to about 1960’s. This timeline was selected specifically to appeal to the elderly, especially for patients suffering from Alzheimer’s. Based on scientific research, it is shown that music and videos/images from a patient’s youth has a positive impact on the patient.
